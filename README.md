# OLED spinner

![screenshot](/anim.gif)

A long time ago I used my sturdy [HP28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-28_series) to render a fancy animation.
But now that little hack is long lost and I finally found a place to re-create that animation; the oled display of my
Kyria keyboard.

This repo contains the relevant snippet of code from my `keymap.c`.

There is also a small python translation to render the same animation as a gif. (To re-render the gif after any
modification invoke it with `uv run render_gif.py`)
